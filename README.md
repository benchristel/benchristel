## Ben Christel's GitHub Profile
I spend a lot of time trying out different approaches to writing code and thinking about why they didn't work. Over the years I've found some things that actually do seem to work. Here you'll find my successes as well as many false starts.

A few highlights:

- My website is [benchristel.com](https://benchristel.com/).
- I am writing a book on software development titled [_Process to Processes_](https://benchristel.github.io/process-to-processes/). I post new chapters weekly to [my Substack newsletter](https://bensguide.substack.com/).
- I also maintain [a personal wiki](https://github.com/benchristel/benchristel.github.io/wiki).
- I used to blog at [benchristel.github.io](https://benchristel.github.io).
- [Taste](https://github.com/benchristel/taste) is my JavaScript test framework, optimized for simplicity and speed.
- In 2022, I started using Linux Mint as my daily driver. Of course I had to [customize](https://github.com/stars/benchristel/lists/linux) it, and those efforts turned into a nostalgia-driven project to recreate the look and feel of Mac OS X 10.6. The whole (very WIP) ensemble is available as [LynX](https://github.com/benchristel/LynX).
- [Culture Machine](https://benchristel.github.io/tv/) layers the UX of TV and radio atop YouTube. It works via a deterministic shuffling algorithm and a declarative convergent feedback loop to keep the player in sync with the "broadcasting" schedule.
- Gavin Morgan and I built [Druthers](https://druthers.app), a group-decision-making app that uses WebRTC and CRDTs for offline-first, multiplayer vote tallying.
- [Here is the code for all the programming projects I did as a kid](https://github.com/benchristel/BensVB) (1998â€“2007). Fortunately, my parents never throw anything away.
